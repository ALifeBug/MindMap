    <div>
      <span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:top; width:120px">
      <div id="myPaletteDiv" style="border: solid 1px black; height:600px"></div>
    </span>
      <span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:top; width:80%">

    <p>
      This sample demonstrates a custom Layout, TableLayout, that is very much like a simplified "Table" Panel layout, but working
      on non-Link Parts in a Diagram or a Group rather than on GraphObjects in a Panel. The layout is defined in its own
      file, as <a href="TableLayout.ts">TableLayout.ts</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can drag-and-drop nodes from the Palette into any Group. Dragging into a Group highlights the Group. Drops must occur
      inside Groups; otherwise the action is cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each row and each column is <a>Part.resizable</a> and has a custom <a>Part.resizeAdornmentTemplate</a> showing a single
      resize handle on the right side or on the bottom. There is a custom LaneResizingTool to provide a minimum width or
      height based on the contents of all of the groups (cells) in that column or row.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example assumes the Groups are predefined and exist in each cell at a particular row/column, but this sample could be
      extended to allow adding and removing rows and/or columns.
